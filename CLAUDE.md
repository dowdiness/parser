# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A Salsa-inspired incremental recomputation library written in MoonBit. Provides automatic dependency tracking, memoization with backdating, and durability-based verification skipping.

## Commands

```bash
moon check          # Type-check without building
moon build          # Build the library
moon test           # Run all tests (162 total across all packages)
moon test -p dowdiness/incr/internal -f memo_test.mbt           # Run tests in a specific file
moon test -p dowdiness/incr/internal -f memo_test.mbt -i 0      # Run a single test by index
moon test -p dowdiness/incr/tests                               # Run integration tests only
```

## Architecture

This library is organized into four MoonBit sub-packages:

```
dowdiness/incr/
├── moon.pkg                    (root facade — imports types + internal + pipeline)
├── incr.mbt                    (pub type re-exports for all public types)
├── traits.mbt                  (IncrDb, Readable, Trackable traits; create_signal, create_memo, create_tracked_cell, batch, gc_tracked helpers)
│
├── types/                      (pure value types, zero dependencies)
│   ├── revision.mbt            (Revision, Durability, DURABILITY_COUNT)
│   └── cell_id.mbt             (CellId + Hash impl)
│
├── internal/                   (all engine implementation + unit tests)
│   ├── cell.mbt                (CellMeta, CellKind)
│   ├── cycle.mbt               (CycleError)
│   ├── tracking.mbt            (ActiveQuery)
│   ├── runtime.mbt             (Runtime, CellInfo)
│   ├── verify.mbt              (maybe_changed_after)
│   ├── signal.mbt              (Signal[T])
│   ├── memo.mbt                (Memo[T])
│   ├── tracked_cell.mbt        (TrackedCell[T])
│   ├── *_test.mbt              (unit tests — black-box tests of the internal package)
│   └── *_wbtest.mbt            (whitebox tests — co-located for private field access)
│
├── pipeline/                   (experimental pipeline traits, zero dependencies)
│   └── pipeline_traits.mbt     (Sourceable, Parseable, Checkable, Executable)
│
└── tests/                      (integration tests — exercises the full @incr public API)
    ├── moon.pkg                (imports dowdiness/incr and dowdiness/incr/pipeline for test)
    ├── integration_test.mbt    (end-to-end graph scenarios)
    ├── fanout_test.mbt         (wide fanout stress tests)
    └── traits_test.mbt         (IncrDb, Readable, and pipeline trait tests)
```

The root package re-exports all public types via `pub type` transparent aliases in `incr.mbt`, so downstream users see a unified `@incr` API with no awareness of the internal package structure.

### Core Computation Model

The library implements Salsa's incremental computation pattern with three key types:

- **Signal[T]** (`internal/signal.mbt`) — Input cells with externally-set values. Support same-value optimization (skip revision bump if value unchanged) and durability levels (Low/Medium/High).
- **Memo[T]** (`internal/memo.mbt`) — Derived computations that lazily evaluate and cache results. Automatically track dependencies via the runtime's tracking stack. Implement **backdating**: when a recomputed value equals the previous value, `changed_at` is preserved, preventing unnecessary downstream recomputation.
- **Runtime** (`internal/runtime.mbt`) — Central state: global revision counter, cell metadata array (indexed by CellId), dependency tracking stack, per-durability revision tracking, and batch state.

### Dependency Graph Internals

- **CellMeta** (`internal/cell.mbt`) — Type-erased metadata for each cell. Stores `changed_at`/`verified_at` revisions, dependency list, durability, `recompute_and_check` closure (derived cells), and `commit_pending` closure (input cells during batch). The `in_progress` flag provides cycle detection.
- **ActiveQuery** (`internal/tracking.mbt`) — Frame pushed onto `Runtime.tracking_stack` during memo computation. Collects dependencies (with HashSet-based O(1) deduplication) read via `Signal::get` or `Memo::get`.
- **Revision** / **Durability** (`types/revision.mbt`) — Monotonic revision counter bumped on input changes. Durability classifies input change frequency; derived cells inherit the minimum durability of their dependencies.
- **Verification** (`internal/verify.mbt`) — `maybe_changed_after()` is the core algorithm. For derived cells: checks the durability shortcut first, then walks dependencies iteratively using an explicit stack of `VerifyFrame`s. If any dependency changed, recomputes the cell (enabling backdating). Green path (no change) marks `verified_at` without recomputation.
- **CycleError** (`internal/cycle.mbt`) — Cycle detection error type. `CycleError::from_path(path, closing_id)` constructs a `CycleDetected` value from a collected path; `format_path(rt)` produces a human-readable chain string.
- **Traits** (`traits.mbt`) — `IncrDb`, `Readable`, and `Trackable` public traits; `create_signal`, `create_memo`, `create_tracked_cell`, `batch`, and `gc_tracked` helper functions. Pipeline traits (`Sourceable`, `Parseable`, `Checkable`, `Executable`) live in `pipeline/pipeline_traits.mbt` and are marked experimental.

### Data Flow

1. `Signal::set()` bumps the global revision and records `changed_at` on the signal's CellMeta (or defers to batch if inside `Runtime::batch()`)
2. `Memo::get()` checks `verified_at` against current revision; if stale, calls `maybe_changed_after()`
3. `maybe_changed_after()` iteratively verifies dependencies using an explicit stack, recomputing only cells whose inputs actually changed
4. Backdating: if a Memo recomputes to the same value, `changed_at` stays old, so downstream cells skip recomputation
5. Durability shortcut: if no input of a cell's durability level changed, verification is skipped entirely
6. Batch mode: `Runtime::batch(fn)` groups multiple signal updates into a single revision with two-phase commit and revert detection

### MoonBit Conventions

- Tests use `///|` doc-comment prefix followed by `test "name" { ... }` blocks
- Assertions use `inspect(expr, content="expected")` pattern
- Panic tests: `test "panic ..."` (name starting with `"panic "`) expects `abort()` to fire — the test runner marks it passed when the abort occurs
- Whitebox tests (`*_wbtest.mbt`): live in `internal/` alongside the private types they test; can access private fields and internal functions
- Unit tests (`*_test.mbt`): live in `internal/` alongside source; test the internal package API as a black-box consumer
- Integration tests: live in `tests/`; test the full `@incr` public API end-to-end across multiple scenarios
- The `internal/` package imports `moonbitlang/core/hashset` as its only external dependency
- `internal/moon.pkg` suppresses warning 15 (`unused_mut`) because `recompute_and_check` is only written in whitebox test compilation, not source-only compilation
- Anonymous callbacks use arrow function syntax: `() => expr` (zero params, single expression), `() => { stmts }` (multi-statement), `x => expr` (one param), `(x, y) => expr` (multiple params). Empty bodies use `() => ()` — not `() => {}` which MoonBit parses as a map literal. Named functions (`pub fn`, `fn name(...)`) are unaffected.
