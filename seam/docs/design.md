# seam — Design Principles

This document records the design principles for the `seam` library's public API.
It is written for future implementors extending the library, particularly the
`SyntaxNode` and `SyntaxToken` layer.

---

## Core goal

`seam` must run gracefully on all input — including trees produced by
error-recovery parsers — while providing explicit, type-level signals when a
query produces no meaningful result. It must never panic on well-typed input.

---

## The three-layer API model

### Layer 1 — Total functions (never panic)

Every basic query returns a value for any input. A tree produced by error
recovery, a zero-length node, or an offset that falls outside the tree will
all produce a valid return value rather than an abort or exception.

```moonbit
find_at(offset)   -> SyntaxNode   // returns self when no child covers offset
start()           -> Int
end()             -> Int
kind()            -> RawKind
children()        -> Array[SyntaxNode]
tokens()          -> Array[SyntaxToken]
all_children()    -> Array[SyntaxElement]
```

**Why:** IDEs always operate on partially-formed source. A panic mid-traversal
during an incremental re-parse is worse than a conservative fallback. The
fallback contract must be documented in the function's doc comment so callers
know what "nothing found" looks like.

**Tradeoff:** A total function that returns `self` on bad input can look like
success to a careless caller. This is why Layer 2 exists.

### Layer 2 — Checked functions (explicit `Option` signalling)

Operations where "nothing here" is a meaningful, common outcome return `T?`.
The IDE gets a type-level signal rather than a fallback it must detect manually.

```moonbit
find_at_checked(offset) -> SyntaxNode?   // None = offset outside span
parent()                -> SyntaxNode?   // None = this is the root
first_child()           -> SyntaxNode?   // None = leaf or empty node
first_token()           -> SyntaxToken?  // None = no tokens in subtree
find_token(kind)        -> SyntaxToken?  // None = no matching token
```

**Why:** Without this layer, every IDE caller must manually re-check spans after
calling a total function. Option types encode the contract in the type system.

**Relationship to Layer 1:** Layer 2 functions are thin wrappers over Layer 1.
`find_at_checked` is just `find_at` with a span check. Layer 1 is the efficient
recursive workhorse; Layer 2 is the safe public entry point for consumers.

### Layer 3 — Error information

For IDE diagnostics, callers need to know whether a subtree contains
error-recovery nodes — not just that a query returned a fallback.

```moonbit
is_error(error_kind : RawKind) -> Bool
contains_errors(error_node_kind : RawKind, error_token_kind : RawKind) -> Bool
```

`CstNode::has_errors` already exists. `SyntaxNode` should expose it directly
so callers do not need to reach through `.cst`.

**Why:** An IDE wants to skip hover/completion logic on error subtrees, or show
a distinct diagnostic highlight. This requires knowing *why* a subtree is
malformed, not just that a query produced a fallback.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

| Pattern | Problem |
|---|---|
| `abort` / `panic` on bad input | Crashes on error-recovery trees; hard to debug |
| Silent fallback that looks like success | `find_at(9999)` returns root — caller cannot distinguish from a real result without a span check |
| Magic sentinel values | `RawKind(-1)`, returning `-1` for "not found" — implicit, easy to forget to check |
| Public constructors with unchecked offsets | `SyntaxNode::new(cst, None, arbitrary_offset)` bypasses the invariant that offset must derive from tree structure |

---

## Phase 1 / Phase 2 boundary

**Phase 1 (current):** `.cst` field is public. All three struct fields
(`cst`, `parent`, `offset`) are readable by callers. Layer 1 functions are
complete. Layer 2 is partial (`find_token` returns `SyntaxToken?`; others are
missing).

**Phase 2 (planned):** Privatise `offset` and `parent` fields. Expose them
only through methods (`start()`, `end()`, `parent() -> SyntaxNode?`). Add
the missing Layer 2 checked functions. Add Layer 3 error-information methods.

The public field `cst` is the intentional Phase 1 escape hatch; `offset` and
`parent` are internal implementation details that happen to be public only
because MoonBit has no field-level visibility.

  `seam` is modelled after. Its `SyntaxNode::covering_element` is total;
  `SyntaxNode::token_at_offset` returns an enum that explicitly represents the
  "nothing here" and "on boundary" cases.

  design; all queries are total over error nodes.
