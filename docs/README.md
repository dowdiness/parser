# Documentation Index

This directory contains design, correctness, performance, and historical notes
for the incremental parser. Use this index as the canonical entry point.

## Start Here

- [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) — Current architecture, phases, and risks
- [CORRECTNESS.md](CORRECTNESS.md) — Correctness goals and verification
- [PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md](PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md) — Benchmarks and analysis

## Implementation Notes

- [STRUCTURAL_VALIDATION.md](STRUCTURAL_VALIDATION.md) — Structural validation details
- [LEZER_IMPLEMENTATION.md](LEZER_IMPLEMENTATION.md) — What was learned from Lezer
- [LEZER_FRAGMENT_REUSE.md](LEZER_FRAGMENT_REUSE.md) — Fragment reuse research notes
- [EDGE_CASE_TESTS.md](EDGE_CASE_TESTS.md) — Edge-case test catalog

## Benchmarks and History

- [benchmark_history.md](benchmark_history.md) — Historical benchmark log

## Legacy / Historical Documents

These predate the Phase 0 cleanup and are retained for context. They are not
authoritative for current architecture.

- [archive/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](archive/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- [archive/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md](archive/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md)
- [archive/COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md](archive/COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md)
- [archive/lezer.md](archive/lezer.md)

## Planning Artifacts

Plans in `docs/plans/` are implementation-time sequencing artifacts. They are
useful for historical context, but are not authoritative for current behavior.
Prefer active, non-plan documentation in `docs/` for source-of-truth status.


## Archive

- [archive/TODO_ARCHIVE.md](archive/TODO_ARCHIVE.md)
